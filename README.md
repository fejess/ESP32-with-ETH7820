# ETH7820-with-ESP32

SIMPLE project ESP32 with ETH7820AI, without PHY power and clock out.
!! Don't use for now !!

Code, bug fixes, eagle libraries are coming soon...

Board is already under testing. 
Knowing issues: 
-ETH get high temperatures. Ground pad is now bigger, waiting for new prototype.
-Feedback leds on RJ45 not wired correctly
